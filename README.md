Refactoring starter code to make website more accessible

Many websites have been designed and built in a way which are inaccessible for people with permanent and temporary disabilities. Not only does this mean that they have trouble experiencing the website, but from a business point of view it can also affect the Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) of that website and the traffic it drives through.

The code in this repository has been refactored to make it more accessible for the people who use it to improve their experience and improve SEO rankings.

Within the code:

- There is semantic use of HTML elements in the source code. 
- The code follows a logical structure. 
- There is specificity to keep the HTML and CSS in separate files. 
- Image and icons have 'alt' attributes. 
- Headings follow a sequential order. 
- Title elements contain descriptive titles.

Below is a screenshot of how the site should look:
